## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

```{r}

data("mtcars")

boxplot(mtcars$hp ~ factor(mtcars$cyl), 
        main = "Boxplot of HP by Cylinders", 
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders", ylab = "Horse Power")



```

This boxplot has not outliers.
